#3.1 Code Dissection

##Activity: JSDissect.html

-----------------------------------

###Instructions:

   * Download the file JSDissect.html sent via Slack, open it in Chrome, and observe what happens.


   * After you finish, open the file in Sublime and with a partner, try to make connections between what is written in the code, and what happened on the page.


   * After we have covered more about Javascript, we will revisit this code later.


   * __Additional Note: When downloading code from Slack, be sure to hit "Download". If you copy and paste directly from Slack into Sublime, your code will not work.__
