###Solution Notes:

   * [Please check out the solution on YouTube.(https://img.youtube.com/vi/zJO9g7S2_Xo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJO9g7S2_Xo)

   * We used a for-loop that rotates through the zooAnimals array based on its length.

   * For variable *__i__*, which starts at 0, as long as *__i__* is less than the length of the zooAnimals array, and increasing i by 1 each time we loop through.

   * We then console log the items each time based upon it's index number, which starts at 0 and ends at 3.
